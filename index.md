### **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

---

**2021 ~ 2024**

Computer Graphics Engineer | Avatar Medical

I worked for Avatar Medical has full time employee and a intern over multiple years.
I developed a volumetric raytracing engine in Unity from scratch, optimizing it for cloud execution and image streaming. This role also provided me with a deep dive into C#, enhancing my programming skills and understanding of complex system design.

**2019**

Software Engineer Intern | Airthium

During my 6-month internship at Airthium, I contributed to the open-source FreeFEM project, a multi-physics simulation software. I developed a new visualization tool from the ground up to display simulation results and integrated it with FreeFEM, enabling network transfer between the two. My work involved utilizing Vulkan for high-performance rendering, enhancing the overall user experience.

### EDUCATION

---

**2017 - 2023**

Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science | Epitech

GPA: 3.00

At Epitech, I engaged in diverse projects that honed my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. I tackled complex challenges in software development, collaborated on innovative solutions, and applied my knowledge to real-world scenarios.

### MY PROJECTS

---

Parsing

[https://github.com/QuentinTessier/ZigParsec](https://github.com/QuentinTessier/ZigParsec)

**ZigParsec**

Exploration of Zig to build parser combinator following Haskell Parsec library. Comes with all default combinators and an Expression parser that can create an Abstract Syntax Tree given a simple operator table. Intend to use it to build a custom shader language for Antlene.

Game Engine

[https://github.com/QuentinTessier/Antlene](https://github.com/QuentinTessier/Antlene)

**Antlene**

My current main project, heavely work in progress. Built using Zig, Vulkan, Entt and more cool tech. You can also find some of the dependencies I am building by hand with it on my github (windowing API, math API, graphic abstraction, ‚Ä¶)
